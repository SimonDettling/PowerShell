# PHP 7 Syntax Check using PowerShell

This PowerShell Scripts perform a Syntax Check on PHP Files, to give you a big picture on how you can upgrade to the next major Version of PHP.

The Script is completley documented with examples on my Blog: Automated PHP 7 Syntax Check using PowerShell.

The Script is tested on a Windows Server 2012 R2 and on a Windows 10, using the RTM Version of PHP 7.
