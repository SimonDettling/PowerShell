# Rearm Office Installation when creating a Reference Image using MDT

# Important
**With the Release of Update 2 for MDT 2013, the Rearm functionality is now present in LTISysprep.wsf, for Office 2013 and for Office 2016. If you already run Update 2, you donâ€™t need to implement my Rearm Script!**
